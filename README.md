# Twitter Scraper

Scraper built to pull information from twitter to make it easier for researchers to input the data into their various programs.

## To run:
You will need admin rights or to have Python 3 as well as python3-pip installed. This script is only available for Ubuntu Linux.
    sudo ./run.sh

This script will install everything for you, it needs sudo to install all the relevant packages. However it will only look for a file named "scrape_me" in /home/liz/Downloads. To change this please enter your files path on line 5.
